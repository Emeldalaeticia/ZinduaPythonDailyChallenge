A Prime Number is a positive interger that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The code is written in Python and I start with a for loop that iterates througha range of numbers from 0 to 999 and is assigned to the variable num. Prime numbers are numbers greater than one therefore the if statement checks if the current 'num' is greater than 1. 

If the contion is true the code enters a nested loop with a range starting from 2 and ending at 'num'. The loop then checks whether the 'num' is divisible by any number between 2 and 'num' using the modulus operator. If the remainder is 0, then it means the 'num' is not a prime number and the break is statement is used,causing the nested loop to stop. 

The else staement is the executed and is indented at the same level as the for loop, which means it only execute only if the loop completes all the iterations without encountering the break staement. If the else statement is not indented properly the results wont be right. 

I had a challenge because my results kept rpeating the prime numbers and excluding 2 because i had indented the else statement wrongly. The else statement prints out the prime number'num'. 

The final output of the code are all the prime numbers with the range of 0 to 999.
