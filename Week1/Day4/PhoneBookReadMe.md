The code defines an empty dictionary called phonebook to store the contact information, where the name of each contact is the key and the phone number is the value.

Dictionaries are useful for storing and retrieving data in a way that is fast and efficient. They allow you to quickly access values by their associated keys, without having to iterate through the entire data structure.

The code defines four functions to perform the various operations of adding, deleting, searching for a contact, and printing all contacts in the phonebook.

Each function prompts the user for input as needed and uses conditional statements and dictionary methods to carry out the requested operation.
An f-string is a way to embed expressions inside string literals, allowing you to create dynamic strings based on the values of variables or expressions. It is denoted by the letter 'f' before the opening quotation mark of a string, followed by curly braces {} containing the expressions or variables you want to include in the string.
For example, in the following line of code:

print(print(f"{name}: {phonebook[name]}")

The 'f' before the opening quotation mark indicates that this is an f-string. The curly braces {} contain the expressions name and phonebook[name], which are variables holding the contact's name and phone number.

When this line of code is executed, Python will replace the expressions inside the curly braces with their corresponding values, and return a formatted string that includes the contact's name and phone number. This makes it easy to print out dynamic, user-specific information in a clear and concise manner.

The while loop in the main program runs indefinitely until the user chooses to exit the app.
The loop displays a menu of options for the user to choose from using the print function.
The loop uses conditional statements to execute the appropriate function based on the user's choice, or to display an error message if the choice is invalid.
