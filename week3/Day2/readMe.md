Address Book Parser 

This code parses a file containing name and address information and converts it into an address book dictionary. It then converts the address book dictionary into a JSON object.

The code imports the json module for working with JSON data.

The parse_file function takes a file_path parameter and reads the contents of the file specified by file_path.

The file contents are split into lines using the newline character as the delimiter.

Each line is further split into a list using the comma and space ", " as the separator, creating a name_address_list containing pairs of name and address information.

An empty dictionary address_book is created to store the address book data.

The code iterates over each name_address pair in name_address_list.

For each pair, the name is extracted from the first element and the address is constructed by concatenating the second and third elements with a comma and space separator.

The name and address are added as key-value pairs to the address_book dictionary.

The populated address_book dictionary is returned.

The file_path variable is set to the path of the file "name_address.txt".

The parse_file function is called with file_path, and the returned address_book dictionary is stored in the address_book variable.

The address_book dictionary is printed to display the contents.

The json.dumps() function is used to convert the address_book dictionary into a formatted JSON string, which is stored in the json_object variable.

The json_object is printed to display the JSON representation of the address book dictionary.

This code demonstrates how to parse a file containing name and address information, create an address book dictionary, and convert it to a JSON object. The JSON representation can be used for data storage, transmission, or further processing
