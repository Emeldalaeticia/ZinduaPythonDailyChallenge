This code performs several operations related to extracting and manipulating phone numbers and email addresses within a given string.

First you import thr re module

The extract_phone_number function uses the regular expression pattern r"\d{3}\D{0,3}\d{3}\D{0,3}\d{4}" to find phone numbers in the input string. It returns a list of all phone numbers found.

The extract_email_addresses function utilizes the regular expression pattern r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b" to extract email addresses from the input string. It returns a list of all email addresses found.

The replace_email_addresses function replaces email addresses in the input string with a provided replacement string. It uses the same email pattern as extract_email_addresses to identify the email addresses and utilizes the re.sub function to perform the replacement. The modified string is then returned.

The code defines a string variable called string containing a sample text that includes a phone number and an email address.

The print(extract_phone_number(string)) statement calls the extract_phone_number function with the string as an argument and prints the resulting phone numbers.

The print(extract_email_addresses(string)) statement calls the extract_email_addresses function with the string as an argument and prints the extracted email addresses.

The print(replace_email_addresses(string, "sunsetsweet@gmail.com")) statement calls the replace_email_addresses function with the string and the replacement email address as arguments. It replaces the email address found in the input string with the provided replacement and prints the modified string.

By executing this code, you can extract phone numbers, extract email addresses, and replace email addresses within a given string.
